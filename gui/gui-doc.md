# How to install papyrus-gui
First off, [download papyrus.cs](https://github.com/mjungnickel18/papyruscs/releases) or [papyrus.js](https://github.com/clarkx86/papyrusjs/releases) and unzip it somewhere you can find it again. Then, [download papyrus-gui](https://github.com/clarkx86/papyrus-gui/releases) and also unzip that. Now you can open papyrus-gui.exe (you might get a security warning from Windows Defender, just click "Show more" and "Do it anyway"). You should see something simular to this:

## How to use papyrus-gui
Next click the button that says "Configure" to select the papyrus instance that you unzipped earlier. You should see something similar to the screenshot below. Click "Browse" and go to the unzipped map and select the .exe file. The "Invalid" next to the "Browse" button should change to "Ok!" if it's the correct file. On this screen you can configure some more things, but that isn't necessary for now so we'll just close this window.

Now to select the world folder, you can press the "Select" button underneath the "Configure" button or press Windows key + R, enter `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\minecraftWorlds` (obviously replace USERNAME with your own Windows username) and select the world folder. Click on the adress bar (see screenshot) and copy and paste that into the world folder text area.

Finally, select an output map by pressing the last "Select button" and hit Render. You should see some movement in the console area and when finished, it should say something like this:

Navigate to the output map and click "index.html" and the map will open in your browser, like in the screenshot below.
